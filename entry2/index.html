<p>Every season brings its own rhythm, a quiet shift that pulls us inward. While Libra reminded us to find balance, Scorpio invites us to go deeper, trust our instincts and embrace what’s hidden.<p>


<p>Pause here. Can you recall a moment when you listened to your gut and it was right?</p>

<p>Transformation happens quietly, in the choices we make, the fears we outgrow and the moments we choose to begin again. Scorpio season reminds us that endings and beginnings are often the same thing, and that change, however uncomfortable, is a form of renewal.</p>

    This week, the sun moves through Scorpio, the sign of depth, intuition and rebirth. Scorpio reminds us that growth requires honesty, the courage to let go of old patterns and step into the unknown.

<p>
    Before you scroll, take a moment to think: What is the one truth that you have been avoiding and what would it feel like to face it?
</p>

<p>Think about the ways you transform without even realizing it, the small decisions that shift your perspective, the conversations that change your direction, or the quiet ways you release what no longer serves you.</p>

<p>Choose one practice that helps you connect with your inner voice this week. It could be journaling before bed, taking a quiet walk without your phone or meditating for a few minutes as a reminder to pause and listen. Notice how paying attention brings clarity to what’s shifting within you.<p>
